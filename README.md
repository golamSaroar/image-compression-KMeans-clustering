## Image Compression with K-Means Clustering

In this project, I have used K-Means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to build an image compression application with interactive controls.

The project consists of the following steps:

- Pre-processing high-resolution image data for k-means clustering.
- Conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization.
- Applying a computationally time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress images.
- Leveraging the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.

Please have a look at the notebook [here](image-compression-KMeans-clustering.ipynb), or open it on [Colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YFd8tuF44rapnn7lsCWgoZwDOZm7GxS2/view?usp=sharing).
